        <h2> Greetings! My name is Matthew. Nice to meet you!</h2>
        <p>I am a software engineering student at Thinkful.</p> 
        <p> My goals are to:</p>
        <ul> 
          <li>Develop functionally beautiful websites</li>
          <li>Use my imagination to write awesome frontend & backend applications through JavaScript.</li>
          <li>To meet other programmers & developers for collaboration</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>Feel free to take a look around!</p>

         <h2>About Matthew</h2>
         <p>I am currently located in Central Virginia--about 30 minutes south of Richmond. I have worked for Starbucks for nearly 11 years, and my role is shift supervisor. I enjoy hiking with my dog and writing and recording music.</p>
         <p>After years of entertaining a potential career change, I decided to take the plunge into learning software development. I am happy to have found Thinkful to help me kickstart this journey!</p> 
         <p>While I am very new to web development, I have enjoyed learning:</p>
         <ol> 
           <li>The basics of JavaScript and learning how to effectively write my own code that can add to the functionality of a website.</li> 
           <li>Building webpages from scratch using HTML and CSS.</li> 
         </ol>
           <p>It's very rewarding to see where I've come from in just a few months.</p>
         <p>If you are interested in hiring a new developer that will offer creative solutions and think outside of the box, feel free to contact me! I also love meeting other developers, so let's get in touch!</p>
